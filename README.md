# Super 8

## Description
This is just a fun side project to test out web and game development. We'll see where it goes from here ;).

## Setup / Install

To get started you need to install [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) afterwards you can run `npm install` to get all the necessary project dependencies.

To run the server run `npm start` (or `npm run dev` if in development and you need rerun the server on file changes) in this directory.

Afterwards you should be good to go! Happy coding:) !!1
