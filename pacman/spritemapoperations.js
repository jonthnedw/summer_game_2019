/* Game board will use a 31x28 tile set, rendered from the sprite map (spritemap-384.png). 
The canvas size will exactly match the size of the laid out tile set. 
Each tile will be 24x24 pixels. 
This means the game boardâ€™s pixel dimensions are: 672x744. */

/* This document will map a character from the sprite map to a tile index. */
